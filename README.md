# Interest Calculator

A script that calculates simple interest given principal, annual rate of interest and time period in years.

### How it works

You have to provide it with a few arguments:
   p, principal amount
   t, time period in years
   r, annual rate of interest
  
Which will calculate and provide the result:
   simple interest = p*t*r
